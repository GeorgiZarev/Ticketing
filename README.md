Ticketing System

Technologies Used: MERN Stack, Next.js, NATS Streaming, Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud

Project Overview:
The Ticketing System is a sophisticated web application designed to manage ticket bookings and events with a highly scalable and resilient architecture. This project showcases my ability to integrate multiple technologies and manage complex systems.

Key Features and Technologies:

Microservices Architecture: Designed the system using a microservices approach to ensure scalability and maintainability. Each service, such as ticket creation, order management, and payment processing, operates independently and communicates through NATS Streaming for event-driven data sharing.

Frontend with Next.js: Utilized Next.js to build a dynamic, server-rendered React application. This provided improved SEO and faster page load times, enhancing the user experience for both desktop and mobile users.

Backend with MERN Stack: Implemented backend services using Node.js and Express.js, connected to a MongoDB database for efficient data management and storage. The use of Mongoose facilitated schema-based data modeling.

Containerization with Docker: Deployed each service in isolated containers using Docker, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages. This containerization helped streamline the deployment process and enhance system stability.

Orchestration with Kubernetes: Managed and orchestrated the Docker containers using Kubernetes, which provided powerful tools for scaling, load balancing, and maintaining the health of the services. This setup allowed for automatic scaling based on traffic and ensured high availability.

Cloud Deployment on Google Cloud: Deployed the entire system on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), utilizing GCP's infrastructure for its robust and secure environment. This included the use of Kubernetes Engine for container orchestration and Cloud Storage for managing data.

Event-Driven Communication with NATS Streaming: Leveraged NATS Streaming for asynchronous communication between services. This event-driven approach enabled real-time updates and ensured that the system could handle high volumes of transactions efficiently.
